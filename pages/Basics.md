# Intro to Organic Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry can be divided to two entities
	- Aromatic Compounds (like C_{6}H_{6})
		- Aromatic Compounds are also known as cyclic or closed chains.
		- ![Cyclopentane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Cyclopentane.svg)
	- Non-aromatic Compounds (like CH_{4}, C_{2}H_{4}, etc.)
		- Non-aromatic Compounds can be straight or branched chain.

  Hydrogen will always be in a **single bond**.

- ## Catenation property of Carbon
- Carbon can form *really* long chains using its catenation property.
- It doesn't have any limit to how many Carbons can attach.
- Carbon also has a valency of 4.
-
- Any empty bonds will aggregate between two Carbon atoms

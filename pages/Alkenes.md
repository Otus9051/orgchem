## Double Bond
	- Alkenes are **unsaturated** aliphatic [open-chain structure] hydrocarbons that contain one **double bond**
	- They are also called **olefins** [oil forming] because the lower members of alkenes form oily products when they are treated with $$\ce {Cl}$$ or $$\ce {Br}$$. Alkenes form a homologous series having the general formula $$\ce {CnH2n}$$

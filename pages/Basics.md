# Intro to Organic Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry can be divided to two entities
	- Aromatic Compounds (like C_{6}H_{6})
		- Aromatic Compounds are also known as cyclic or closed chains.
		- ![Cyclopentane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Cyclopentane.svg)
	- Non-aromatic Compounds (like CH_{4}, C_{2}H_{4}, etc.)
		- Non-aromatic Compounds can be straight or branched chain.

  Hydrogen will always be in a **single bond**.

- ## Catenation property of Carbon
	- Carbon can form *really* long chains using its catenation property.
	- It doesn't have any limit to how many Carbons can attach.
	- Carbon also has a valency of 4.
	- Any empty bonds will aggregate between two Carbon atoms

- ## Aromatic Compounds
	- Let's look at the structure of Benzene.
	- ![Benzene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Benzene_200.svg/894px-Benzene_200.svg.png){:height 200, :width 200}
	- This is the normal way you would write it. The lines after the hexagon are double bonds.
		- It being a hexagonal structure, we can say that the formula is C_{6}H_{6}
		- It can also be deconstructed, like so:
		- ![Benzene 2D, full structure.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Benzene-2D-full.svg)
		- Now, we can see each Hydrogen and Carbon atom.
		- As it is a cyclic compound, it can also resonate and change the position of the bonds, totally clockwise. It being called a resonant structure.
-
- ## Saturation and Unsaturation
	- A saturated or unsaturated compound can be determined by the number of Hydrogen atoms present in the compound.
	- A saturated compound is where no more hydrogen can be accommodated. z.B.: Alkane
	- An unsaturated compound is where more hydrogen atoms *can* be accommodated. z.B.: Alkene, Alkyne.
-
- ## Functional Groups
	- A chemical group present in the organic compound and which determines the characteristic of the organic compound.
	- z.B.:
		- -COOH [Carboxylic Acid]
		- -CHO [Aldehyde]
		- Ketone

		- -NH_{2} [Amine]
		- -OH [Hydroxyl]
		- -CH_{3} [Methyl]
		- USW.
	- ### Carboxylic Group

- ## Isomerism
	- It is defined as a compound having the same molecular formula but different structure.

	- Here, Dimethyl ether is an isomer of Ethanol.

	- ### Stereoisomer
		- Rearrangement of Atoms
	- ### Structural Isomer
		- Rearrangement of Molecules
	- ### Chain Isomerism
		- Different arrangement of Carbon Atoms
	- ### Position Isomerism
		- Different position of bonds.
